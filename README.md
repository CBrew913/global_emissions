# Global Methane Emissions Data Visualization

This project aims to analyze global methane emissions data from various sources to understand the trends and patterns in methane emissions worldwide.

## Data

The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions).
- The license for this data is [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

## Analysis

The analysis performed on the dataset includes the following:

- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of methane emissions across countries and over time.
- Segemnt analysis to explore emission levels from industry segments.
- Region and country analysis to visualize methane emissions from parts of the globe.

The analysis was performed using Python and various data analysis libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To reproduce the analysis, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `emissions_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the data analysis.
- `Methane_final.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter Notebook server.
4. Open `emissions_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each code cell and reproduce the analysis.
